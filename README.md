# Bellybutton_Biodiversity

## Overview

This project introduced us to plot.ly and advanced work with JavaScript and HTML files.  The purpose of this project was to oull demographic data from a Json file, and use plotly to visually represent a bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart representing the dat from each subject.  The charts were then represented on an interactive HTML where users could chose a subject, adn see the bacterial informayion given for that subject.  
Another aspect of the project was to customize the page.  I included a background image for the jumbotron header, a beige background color, and a short snippet at the bottom of the page explaining the purpose of the site, as shown below.

For some reason, my charts.js file was not pulling the information from the json file; therefore my graphs were not respresented visually.  However, I intend to keep messing with the file to see if I can make it work, and I have included the code I have for now.
